#  Hello  guys
In this project you will learn how to create one of the simplest neural networks called Adaline.

This project will detect the patterns on the board, this patterns consists of: X and O.

Create Every kind of X or O on the board, like the pictures below;

<p align="center">
  <img height="10%" width='100%' src="https://github.com/mralamdari/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/X%26O_With_MLP/1.JPG"/>
</p>

  <img height="10%" width='100%' src="https://github.com/mralamdari/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/X%26O_With_MLP/2.JPG"/>
</p> 

And you can create your own samples and store it in the dataset.csv file, like;

  <img height="10%" width='100%' src="https://github.com/mralamdari/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/X%26O_With_MLP/3.JPG"/>
</p> 

the trained weights will be stored in the Formula file, so it can be used in the testing part.
